"""Generate the service landing pages in website/public/.

Ad traffic needs a page about the one style the ad showed, not the whole
site. These are those pages.

EVERY FACT HERE IS ALREADY PUBLISHED SOMEWHERE ON THE SITE:
  price, duration, description   -> the services table / the spec table
  preparation                    -> policies.html "Hair & Preparation"
  48 hours to book or cancel     -> policies.html, owner-confirmed 2026-08-26
  children, tension, aftercare   -> policies.html and #words

Nothing style-specific is invented. Where a style has no published price the
page says so plainly, exactly as the service cards do. If the owner later
supplies per-style prep notes or FAQs, add them to SERVICES below and re-run.
