"""Build the SEO service landing pages under website/public/<slug>/index.html.

CLEAN URLS WITHOUT SERVER CONFIG. Pages are written as <slug>/index.html so
static hosting serves them at /<slug>/ with no extension and no Amplify
rewrite rule — which matters because the rewrite console is not reachable
from here.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT INVENTED
Prices, durations, preparation, deposit facts, the 48-hour notice, tension
and parting standards, hours and address all come from the live site or the
services table. Descriptions of what a hairstyle *is* are general hairdressing
fact and are safe to write.

NOT WRITTEN, because the salon has not published them (reported to the owner
instead of guessed):
  - deposit AMOUNT           (that a deposit exists is published; how much is not)
  - hair included yes/no     (never stated anywhere)
  - size options S/M/L       (only "many sizes and lengths", on box braids)
  - length options
  - how many weeks each style lasts
  - prices/durations for Fulani, Kids' and Goddess braids

Where a fact is missing the section is OMITTED rather than shown with a
placeholder. Visible "[TO BE CONFIRMED]" on a live commercial page is the
thing we spent this project removing.

GALLERIES are assembled from images whose existing alt text identifies the
service. There is only one purpose-shot per service, so counts vary from 1 to
5; the spec asked for 3-6 and several services cannot reach it without
passing off a photo of one style as another.
