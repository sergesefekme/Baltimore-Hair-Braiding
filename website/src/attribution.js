/* ---------------------------------------------------------
   Where the booking came from
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   Answers "which ad produced this appointment?" without a cookie, a pixel,
   or a third party. Everything here is read from the URL the visitor arrived
   on and the referrer the browser volunteers, held for the length of the tab,
   and submitted with the booking.

   WHY NOT A PIXEL. The published privacy policy says this site sets no
   cookies and runs no advertising or cross-site tracking. That is a promise
   worth keeping, and first-party UTM capture answers the spend question
   anyway: it ties a booking to the exact campaign that produced it. What it
   cannot do is feed Meta's optimiser. That is the trade, and it was made
   deliberately.

   FIRST TOUCH WINS. The attribution is written once per tab and never
   overwritten. A visitor who arrives from a Facebook ad, wanders the site,
   and books twenty minutes later is still a Facebook booking - if the last
   navigation won instead, most bookings would credit themselves to "direct".

   sessionStorage, not localStorage: it is gone when the tab closes, which is
   the least the job can get away with. It is not a cookie and is not readable
   by any other site.
